    <h2> History<br></h2>
       
</p> 
<img src="../images/sn2.webp" alt="">
<p>Snow sports have a long history, dating back to ancient times when people used skis for transportation in snowy regions. The modern form of skiing emerged in Norway in the 19th century, with cross-country skiing gaining popularity. Alpine skiing developed in the early 1900s, and by the 1930s, ski resorts began to grow in Europe and North America. Snowboarding originated in the 1960s in the United States, evolving from surfing and skateboarding. By the 1990s, snowboarding became an Olympic sport, alongside skiing. The Winter Olympics, first held in 1924, showcased a variety of snow sports, including ice hockey and figure skating. In the late 20th century, freestyle skiing, snowboarding, and extreme sports began to gain global attention. Today, snow sports have become a multi-billion-dollar industry, attracting millions of enthusiasts worldwide. The evolution of technology continues to impact equipment, safety standards, and the overall experience.<br></p>
   <p>Snow sports have a rich and diverse history that spans centuries. Early forms of skiing, dating back over 4,000 years, were used for transportation and hunting in cold regions like Scandinavia and Asia. The modern concept of recreational skiing began to take shape in the 19th century in Norway, where it was initially popularized as a sport. Cross-country skiing was the first major discipline, followed by the development of alpine skiing in the early 20th century. Skiing rapidly gained popularity in the Alps, and ski resorts began to appear in Europe and the United States, attracting tourists from around the world.
