                <hr> <p>Bowling is a popular sport where players roll a heavy ball down a lane with the goal of knocking down pins arranged in a triangular shape. The standard game features ten pins and is played over ten frames. Each player gets two chances to knock down all ten pins in each frame, except for the tenth, where a player may get a third roll if they score a strike or spare. A strike occurs when all ten pins are knocked down on the first roll of a frame. A spare is when all ten pins are knocked down after both rolls in a frame. Points are awarded based on how many pins are knocked down, with bonus points added for strikes and spares. The maximum score is 300, achieved by getting a strike in every frame. Bowling can be played casually or competitively, often in leagues or tournaments. It is a sport enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels.
